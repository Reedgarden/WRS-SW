\subsection{Timing error}
As a timing error we define WR Switch not being able to provide its slave
nodes/switches with correct timing information consistent with the rest of the
WR network.\\

\noindent Faults leading to a timing error:

				timestamps resolution. For Grand Master the reason of \emph{SoftPLL}
				going out of lock might be disconnected 1-PPS/10MHz signals or external

				it calculates new phase shift based on the Master-to-Slave delay
				variations. To calculate these variations, it still needs timestamped
				PTP frames flowing. There could be several causes of such fault:

				wrong VLAN configuration and HDL problems we can monitor if PTP frames
				are flowing on Slave port(s) of WRS and raise an alarm (change status
				word) if they don't flow anymore. We should combine this with the link
				status (up/down). If VLANs are misconfigured, we don't receive PTP
				frames, but the link is still up. This could let us distinguish from a
				lack of frames due to the link down (which is a separate issue).

				Gigabit SFP can be used (also copper). Detecting if a non-Gigabit
				Ethernet SFP is plugged into the cage is covered in a separate issue
				\ref{fail:other:sfp} in section \ref{sec:other_fail}.

			\item [] \underline{Description}: \emph{(not yet implemented)}\\
				In case the primary timing link breaks, switchover is responsible for
				seamless switching to the backup one to keep the device in sync. If WRS
				operates in a \emph{Slave} mode, switchover is about switching
				between two (or more) WR links to one or multiple WR Masters. If it
				operates in a \emph{Grand Master} mode, it is about broken/lost
				connection to an external reference and switching to a backup WR link
				(another WR Master). Regardless of the configuration, if we fail to
				switch-over to a backup link (e.g. because the it is down), WRS resets
				the time counters and continue the operation as a Free-Running Master.
			\item [] \underline{SNMP objects}: \emph{(not yet implemented)}
			\item [] \underline{Note}: we should probably use parameters reported by
				the backup channel(s) of the SoftPLL and the backup PTP servo to be able
				to detect and report that something went wrong.

				Signaling active holdover is one thing, but if a Grand Master switch is
				kept in sync with holdover for too long, it might drift away from the
				ideal external reference too much. All devices in WR network will be

\subsection{Data error}
As a data error we define WR Switch not being able to forward Ethernet traffic

				Two early ideas for checking if SwCore is hanging or not:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Monitor the number of used and free pages in the MPM memory
					\item Compare per-port \emph{RTUfwd} counter with the \emph{Tx}
						Endpoint counter for this port. \emph{RTUfwd} counts all forwarding
						decisions from RTU to the port $<$n$>$ (including PTP frames from
						NIC). If this number is equal to the number of frames actually
						transmitted by the Endpoint, then everything works fine).

				The idea for that is to reboot the system if it was not able to boot

			\item [] \underline{!QUESTION!}: \\
				Shall we distinguish between crucial and less crucial processes? We don't do that now.
				We also don't warn in any special way about crashes other than increasing start counters.
			\item [] \underline{Note}: We have to monitor the list of running
				processes and their PIDs. We shall distinguish between crucial
				processes - error should be reported if one of them crashes; and less
				important processes which should just be restarted if they crash (and
				warning should be reported). If any of the processes has crashed, we
				need to restart it and increment a per-process counter reported through
				the SNMP to indicate how many times each process has crashed.\\

				Crucial processes (Error report if any of them crashes):
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \emph{PTP/PPSi}
					\item \emph{WRSW\_RTUd} - after adding configuration preserving code
						on restart, RTUd could be crossed out from this list
					\item \emph{WRSW\_HAL}
				\end{itemize}
				Less critical processes (Restarting them and Warning generation is
				enough):
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \emph{dropbear}
					\item \emph{udhcpc}
					\item \emph{rsyslogd}
					\item \emph{snmpd}
					\item \emph{lighttpd}
					\item \emph{TRUd/eRSTPd} - not yet implemented
				\end{itemize}

				\emph{RTUd} - we need to set the flag that it has crashed so that when
				it runs again it knows that HDL is already configured. It should not
				erase static entries in RTU table (e.g. multicasts for PTP) and it
				should not erase or it should configure again static entries set by-hand
				as well as VLANs. Dynamic entries are not a problem. RTUd will learn all
				MACs after restarting. The only consequence will be increased network
				traffic due to frames broadcast until all MACs are learned. In general
				the source code has to be checked to make sure what is cleared on
				startup and modified to preserve the configuration.\\

				\emph{TRUd/eRSTPd} - topology reconfiguration is done in hardware if
				needed, this daemon is used only to configure TRU/RTU HDL module.
				However, the story is similar as with the RTUd. If eRSTPd crashes, we
				need to store this information so that when it runs again, it does not
				erase the whole configuration. Also if topology reconfiguration is done
				in HDL while eRSTPd is down, HDL should keep the flag that it happened,
				and eRSTPd should read this flag when starting, so that it's aware that
				now, backup link is active.\\

\subsubsection{\bf Kernel freeze}
		\begin{packed_enum}
			\item [] \underline{Description}:
				If kernel freezes we can do nothing. It can freeze e.g. due to some
				infinite in the irq handler. It's like with the power failure, somebody
				has to go to the place where WRS is installed and investigate/restart
				the device.
			\item [] \underline{!QUESTION!}: Do we have watchdog in CPU? can we use it?
			\item [] \underline{SNMP objects}: \emph{(none)}
		\end{packed_enum}

\subsubsection{\bf Power failure}
		\begin{packed_enum}
			\item [] \underline{Description}:\\
				Power failure may be either a WRS problem (i.e. broken power supply
				inside the switch) or an external problem (i.e. providing voltage to the
				device). There is not much reporting we can do in such case, it's up to
				the Network Management Station to raise an alarm if the SNMP Agent does
				not respond to the SNMP requests.
			\item [] \underline{SNMP objects}: \emph{(none)}
		\end{packed_enum}

				If any crucial hardware part breaks we'll most probably notice it as one
				(or multiple) timing/data errors described in the previous sections.
				Besides that, we don't have any self-diagnostics on-board. Few examples:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item DAC / VCO - problems with synchronization
					\item cooling	fans - rise of the temperature inside the WRS box
						(failure \ref{fail:other:temp})
					\item power supply, ARM, FPGA - booting problem (failure
						\ref{fail:other:boot})
					\item memory chip - data corruption (failure \ref{fail:other:memory})

		\label{fail:other:management_link}
		\begin{packed_enum}
			\item [] \underline{Description}:\\
				For obvious reasons we are not able to report through SNMP that the
				management link is down. This should be detected and reported by the NMS
				if it does not receive SNMP and ICMP responses from the WRS.
			\item [] \underline{SNMP objects}: \emph{(none)}
		\end{packed_enum}

\subsubsection{\bf No static IP on the management port \& failed to DHCP}
		\begin{packed_enum}
			\item [] \underline{Description}:\\
				From operator's point of view it is similar to the issue
				\ref{fail:other:management_link}. WRS is not accessible through the
				management port, so its status cannot be reported. This should be
				detected and reported by the NMS if it does not receive SNMP and ICMP
				responses from the WRS. In such case WR expert should make a physical
				connection to the management USB port of the WRS to diagnose the
				problem.
			\item [] \underline{SNMP objects}: \emph{(none)}
		\end{packed_enum}

\subsubsection{\bf IP address on the management port has changed}
		\begin{packed_enum}
			\item [] \underline{Status}: TODO
			\item [] \underline{Severity}: WARNING
			\item [] \underline{Description}:\\
				I'm not yet sure how we should report this. Probably SNMP is not the
				best choice because if the IP changes we're no longer able to poll SNMP
				objects (until IP is updated also in the Network Management Station). We
				should either generate SNMP trap to NMS or send Syslog message to a
				central server.
			\item [] \underline{SNMP objects}: \emph{(not yet implemented)}
		\end{packed_enum}

\subsubsection{\bf Multiple unauthorized access attempts}
		\begin{packed_enum}
			\item [] \underline{Status}: for later
			\item [] \underline{Severity}: WARNING
			\item [] \underline{Description}:\\
				If we observe many attempts to gain a root access through ssh (or the
				web interface) that might mean somebody tries to do something nasty. We
				should report such situation as a Warning.
			\item [] \underline{SNMP objects}: \emph{(not yet implemented)}
			\item [] \underline{Note}: Bad password event is reported by syslog as
				warning. We should probably use this information to add an SNMP object.
		\end{packed_enum}

\subsubsection{\bf Network reconfiguration (RSTP)}
		\label{fail:other:rstp}
		\begin{packed_enum}
			\item [] \underline{Status}: for later
			\item [] \underline{Severity}: WARNING
			\item [] \underline{Description}: \emph{(not yet implemented)}\\
				If topology reconfiguration occurs because of the primary link failure,
				this fact should be reported through SNMP as a warning. It's not
				critical situation, WR network still works. However, further
				investigation should be performed to repair the broken link.
			\item [] \underline{SNMP objects}: \emph{(not yet implemented)}
		\end{packed_enum}

\subsubsection{\bf Backup link down}
		\begin{packed_enum}
			\item [] \underline{Status}: for later
			\item [] \underline{Severity}: WARNING
			\item [] \underline{Description}: \emph{(not yet implemented)}\\
				It's related to the issue \ref{fail:other:rstp}. If the WRS uses primary
				uplink, but the backup one fails, it's not a critical fault. WR Network
				still works, but the problem should be diagnosed and repaired to have
				the backup link operational in case the primary one fails.
