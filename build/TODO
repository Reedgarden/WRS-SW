Things still to do

- build kernel
- build filesystem
- build tools and addons
- check list of tools
- check why the md5sum is different for at91boot
- fix the "fatal" message in u-boot (move ./build away of the git tree)
- document how to reprogram everything in the switch
- fix Environment variable CROSS_COMPILE is not set
