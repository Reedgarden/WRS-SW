This directory includes tests that are meant to be run on the switch
itself.

The directory has been copied from @code{software/tests} as it
appeared in the @i{svn} repository; it has not been recompiled or
verified in any way.  In this version, only wr_mon had been made to
compile, the other tests still include @code{build.sh} that sources
@code{../../settings}, in the old way that is now deprecated.

If you "make" here, only libwripc and wr_mon is compiled.
