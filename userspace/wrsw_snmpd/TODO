    ieee8021bridge
    ==============

- When HW support for Traffic Classes and counters be released, the associated
objects shall be implemented. The same for RSTP and MMRP related objects.

- Add support for persistence when appropriate. For this we may use a
configuration file. This file should be stored in a non-volatile memory and
applied at startup.

- In order to reduce the footprint of the library and the over-complexity of the
auto-generated code, we may re-generate the skeleton code created from the
mib2c.mfd.conf template using this time a more suitable one (probably that used
in the ieee8021qbridge).
