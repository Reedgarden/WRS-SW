Switch V3 Hardware Library (libwr)
-------------------------------

Libwr is a collection of low-level userspace drivers for various
peripherals in the switch, which do not need kernel modules. These are:
- Main FPGA (fpga_io.c) and CPU GPIO ports (pio.c), pin definitions (shw_io.c)
- PPS generator (pps_gen.c, adjustment of time)
- fan control (fan.c)
- i2c communication (i2c.c)
- SFP communication (i2c_sfp.c)
- Network API for WR-PTPd (ptpd_netif.c)

Libwr also provides a single routine to initialize all that stuff (see init.c)
and some utility/tracing functions (trace.c, util.c)
