Switch V2 Hardware Library (libswitchhw)
-------------------------------

Libswitchhw is a collection of low-level userspace drivers for various 
peripherals in the switch, which do not need kernel modules. These are:
- Main FPGA (fpga_io.c) and CPU GPIO ports (pio.c), pin definitions (pio_pins.c)
- AD9516 PLL and clock distribution chip (ad9516.c)
- SPI master for communication with the timing FPGA (clkb_io.c)
- DMTD phase shifter PLL (dmpll.c, main clock recovery PLL - obsolete in V3, 
  to be replaced by the SoftPLL)
- Helper PLL (hpll.c, producing the "slightly offset" frequency for the DMTDs - 
  obsolete in V3, to be replaced by the SoftPLL)
- PPS generator (pps_gen.c, adjustment of time)
- Watchdog SPI link (watchdog.c)
- PHY calibrators (phy_calibration.c, xpoint.c, DS90LVxx buffers in the 
  MiniBackplane V2, ADN4600 crosspoint for clock feedback) and the calibration DMTDs
- Altera FPGA bootloader & revision management (mblaster.c, fpgaboot.c)


Libswitchhw also provides a single routine to initialize all that stuff (see init.c)
and some utility/tracing functions (trace.c, util.c)
