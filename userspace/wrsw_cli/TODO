Informal TODO list
------------------


- Try to reduce the readline footprint by editing
the /$(HOME)/wrdev/build/buildroot-2009.11/output/build/readline-5.2/rlconf.h

- Introduce filtering options to ease the reading of outputs

- Add support for a persistent configuration file.

- Capture signals (i.e. SIGTERM, to execute cli_cmd_exit before leaving the
application, so memory be freed)

- Extend the help for commands and options. (It is probably better to use a
callback function for this, instead of a string).

- Extend the commands.

- Add verbosity to the error messages.
