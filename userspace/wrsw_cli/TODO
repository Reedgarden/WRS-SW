Informal TODO list
------------------

- Extend the commands.

- Extend the commands and options help.

- Try to reduce the readline footprint by editing
the /$(HOME)/wrdev/build/buildroot-2009.11/output/build/readline-5.2/rlconf.h
Or just remove the dependency with this library and make a small one that
handles the command autocompletion and history features.

- Introduce filtering options to ease the reading of outputs

- Support ranges for command arguments (ports, VIDs).

- Add support for a persistent configuration file (although this is a more
general task which affects the configuration capabilities of the switch as
a whole).
