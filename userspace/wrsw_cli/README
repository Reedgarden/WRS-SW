            This package is based on some ideas taken from the LGPL libcli
            package by David Parrish, which you can find at
            https://github.com/dparrish/libcli.git

Short info: Basic CLI implementation for the management of the WR Switch.
            This package has been built taking as a reference the CISCO's CLI
            command syntax (given that it has become an industry standard for
            the management of network devices). However, in WR we don't
            envisage to use the CLI as the front-end for managing or
            configuring the switch operating system, so some simplifications
            have been made.



    General info
    ============

Along with the SNMP agent, the WR CLI is ment to be one of the tools to
configure and monitor the WR Switch. The WR CLI has been designed as another
tool for the WR Switch, not as a front-end to manage the operating system of the
switch (such as the CISCO's CLI does), so the WR CLI doesn't deal with access
priviledges, network tools or anything that can be handled through the Linux
kernel. In fact, the management operations for the CLI are just being defined
in order to meet the conformance with the IEEE standards 802.1D and 802.1Q. No
configuration modes have been defined.

If you need help while using the WR CLI, type 'help' or '?'. These commands
can be also used to get more information on a given command or even to get a
list of available commands.

Some line editing features are available, as well as some command history
capabilities.

Internally, the CLI has been designed trying to reuse the code written for the
SNMP agents, which means that the CLI is going to translate the CLI commands
into SNMP operations that an SNMP client will understand and run, in order to
get the information from the SNMP agent. This way we aim at avoiding duplicate
code and some concurrency issues. The SNMP agent will be who communicates with
hardware.



    Structure of the package
    ========================

README
	This file.

COPYING:
    GNU GPL Version 2. This package is copyrighted by CERN and
    released as free software.

TODO:
    List of things to do.

Makefile:
    Makefile, based on the WR development environment wr-switch-sw-2011-05-18.

cli.[ch]:
    Main function and main loop. Initialization of data structures. Command line
    parsing and line editing features.

cli_commands.[ch]:
    Commands related stuff. Generation of the commands tree. Implementation of
    the functions that handle each command.

cli_snmp.[ch]:
    SNMP utility functions to simplify handling SNMP stuff from CLI modules.


    Dependencies
    ============

GPL readline library:
    This package depends on the readline library, wich in turn depends on the
    ncurses library. The readline library manages the line editing features of
    the CLI and the command history.

net-snmp:



    Compilation and usage
    =====================

For compilation just run make, following the instructions of the documentation
wrs-build.pdf in the wr-switch-sw/doc section, written by Alessandro Rubini.

Everytime you run the wrsw_cli application you must specify a user and password
(with the -u and -p arguments) in order to let the CLI access to the SNMPv3
facilities. This is mandatory for now. Try with:

 ./wrsw_cli -u authPrivUser -p password
