CALLING FUNCTIONS 

Hamming_decode
**************
This function decode word of 64 bits with a 8 bits redundancy, 7 parity checks
bits and 1 complete parity of the word.

INPUT 
std::payload 
unsigned int chunk2encode .- Pointer to the beginning of the words
unsigned int num_chunks.- Position in Chunk2encode of the redundancy 
unsigned int *nBytep.- Position in Bytes of the error
unsigned int *nBitP.- Position in Bits of the error

OUTPUT

unsigned int result .- return if the chunk has one error, two errors and more
than two erros.

Hamming_encode
**************
This function encode words of of 64 into 72 bits, 7 parity checks bits and 1 bit
for the parity of the complete word. 

INPUT
const  char *frame .- payload to encode

OUTPUT 
std::string  with the 8 bits parity bits.
