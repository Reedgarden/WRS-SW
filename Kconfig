	  The configuration file selects which packages are to be
	  included in the WRS filesystem and which are not.  If
	  you pass a relative pathname, the build procedure will
	  look for it in wr-switch-sw/configs/buildroot, while
	  absolute pathnames are used unchanged.

	  If the string being passed doesn't refer to a file, the
	  scripts print a warning and use the default file. Incorrect
	  files lead to unpredicatable results.
