	help
	  The configuration file selects which packages are to be
	  included in the WRS filesystem and which are not.  If
	  you pass a relative pathname, the build procedure will
	  look for it in wr-switch-sw/configs/buildroot, while
	  absolute pathnames are used unchanged.

	  If the string being passed doesn't refer to a file, the
	  scripts print a warning and use the default file. Incorrect
	  files lead to unpredicatable results.

config PTP_NOPOSIX
	bool "Use ptp-noposix daemon"
	help
	  This implementation is being phased out, because it became
	  unmaintainable over time. However, it is still the default
	  at this point in time, because it has been tested and used
	  for a long time.

config PPSI
	bool "Use PPSi daemon"
	help
	  PPSi (PTP Ported to Silicon) is the new implementation, which
	  is already the default PTP run in the White Rabbit node.
