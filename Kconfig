	help
	  The White Rabbit Switch is configured at run-time,
	  according to a dot-config .config file. The file
	  is the same .config you are defining now.  If you
	  select an empty string, dot-config is not replaced
	  at run time.  Otherwise, tftp://, ftp:// or http://
	  URLs are allowed. Names are allowed if you configured
	  a DNS server.  The special strings IPADDR and MACADDR
	   are substituted before retrieving the file.
	  Example:  "tftp://morgana/wrs-config-IPADDR"

config BR2_CONFIGFILE

	help
	  The configuration file selects which packages are to be
	  included in the WRS filesystem and which are not.  If
	  you pass a relative pathname, the build procedure will
	  look for it in wr-switch-sw/configs/buildroot, while
	  absolute pathnames are used unchanged.

	  If the string being passed doesn't refer to a file, the
	  scripts print a warning and use the default file. Incorrect
	  files lead to unpredicatable results.
