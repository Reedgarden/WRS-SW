This is the NIC driver for white rabbit. It is definitely work in progress.

The source has not been tested (only compile-tested), and has been
laid out to be as understandable as possible, since I'm not the one
who's going to debug it.

These notes are for the one who will debug my crap. The published one
will be different, hopefully.

* The different files

The module is called wr-nic.ko which comes from several object files.
This is the layout. Files which need to be fixed have FIXME inside and
in this list as well.

     nic-hardware.h
        this includes only #defines for magic project-wide constants.
        They are most likely wrong, so they must be fixed.
        FIXME: What are the physical addresses for wr_nic registers?

     wr-nic.h
        the header is used for sharing stuff between sources. Unlike
        the previous one, it is at kernel-level abstractions. It includes
        nic-hardware.h
	FIXME: the memory resource list must be verifiedcompleted

     ../wr-headers/
        the directory includes unchanged headers copied from snv:
        http://svn.ohwr.org/white-rabbit/trunk/software/include/hw/

     module.c
        registering and unregistering the module
	FIXME: the memory resource list must be completed

     device.c
        the actual probe and remove functions, and the driver structure
	FIXME: the memory resource list must be verified

     endpoint.c
        talking with the actual endpoints, including the probe part
	FIXME: mii setup is missing

     nic-core.c
        standard networking stuff: interrupts and son on
	FIXME: everything is missing

     ethtool.c
        ethtool operations

     pps.c
        the pulse-per-second mechanism. This might want to be registered
        in Linux using drivers/pps, but it must be looked at. This
        file is currently registering itself as a timesource.
	FIXME: everything

     timestamp.c
        all the stuff related to timestamping
	FIXME: everything

     dmtd.c
        calibration and readout
	FIXME: everything
