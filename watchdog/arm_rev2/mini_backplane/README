WR switch watchdog firmware (for use with mini-backplane)
----------------------------------------------------------

Compilation:
- uses the same GCC as for the ARM9 big CPU. Just run make. No additional tools required

Programming:
- you need OpenOCD installed in your system. Tested on OOCD 0.4.0
- connect the programmer, make sure the big row of jumpers next to CN1 is in "WD" position, as well as JP7 and JP11.
- run "make flash"

Features:
- currently - not much. Just turns on the power supply and allows for modifying LED status and enabling/disabling calibration feedback. See libswitchhw/watchdog.c for API/protocol details

Bugs:
- MISO and MOSI lines are swapped. The ARM9 big CPU must use SPI in bitbanged mode
