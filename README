This package is meant to include all white-rabbit software. Part of
this comes from the white-rabbit svn repository on ohwr.org, part comes
from separate repositories that I merged here.

All documentation lives in doc/ , where all *.in files are the sources
(texinfo files, plain ascii, but please ask me before adding or
removing chapter or sections -- or emacs and its texinfo-mode).

Currently, the input files are the following ones:

doc/wrs-software.in

	top-level documentation. It has some duplication with other files
	because it was born as an alternative setup to the svn repository
	and build scripts.

doc/wrs-build.in

	documentation about the complete build procedure (i.e., the
	part that has been documented so far). Directly related code
	lives in the build/ subdirectory of this package, the other
	is elsewhere (kernel/ userspace/ and patches/so on).

doc/wrs-test.in

	documentation about the testing procedures. Associated code libce

When a tar archive is released, precompiled output files are included.

As I write this (May 2011) this repository is somewhat messy because
it's merge-in-progress between several packages written independently.
