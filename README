This package is meant to include all white-rabbit software for the
switch.  Part of this comes from the original white-rabbit svn
repository on ohwr.org, part comes from separate repositories that I
merged here.

All documentation lives in doc/ , where the *.in files are the sources
(one only, currently, other ones have been removed when obsoleted).

The wrs-build documentation, thus, is what you actually need to build
all the stuff that goes into the switch, and program to internal flash
memory.
