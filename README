This package is meant to include all white-rabbit software. Part of
this comes from the white-rabbit svn repository on ohwr.org, part comes
from separate repositories that I merged here.

All documentation lives in doc/ , where all *.in files are the sources
(texinfo files, plain ascii, but please ask me before adding or
removing chapter or sections -- or emacs and its texinfo-mode).

When tarball are released, output files are part of the archive.

As I write this (Apr 2011) this repository is somewhat messy because
it's merge-in-progress between several packages written independently.
