IMPORTANT NOTE (Mar 2012):

     This is the software repository for version 2
     of the switch. Version 2 is not being produced and only one dozen
     of them exist. If you have version 3, please checkout branch "v3"
     of this same repository (or simply "master" if you do it after
     2012-04-07)

ORIGINAL README follows:

This package is meant to include all white-rabbit software. Part of
this comes from the white-rabbit svn repository on ohwr.org, part comes
from separate repositories that I merged here.

All documentation lives in doc/ , where all *.in files are the sources
(texinfo files, plain ascii, but please ask me before adding or
removing chapter or sections -- or emacs and its texinfo-mode).

Currently, the input files are the following ones:

doc/wrs-software.in

	top-level documentation. It has some duplication with other files
	because it was born as an alternative setup to the svn repository
	and build scripts.

doc/wrs-build.in

	documentation about the complete build procedure (i.e., the
	part that has been documented so far). Directly related code
	lives in the build/ subdirectory of this package, the other
	is elsewhere (kernel/ userspace/ and patches/so on).

doc/wrs-test.in

	documentation about the testing procedures. Associated code libce

When a tar archive is released, precompiled output files are included.

As I write this (May 2011) this repository is somewhat messy because
it's merge-in-progress between several packages written independently.
